## Beans Image Classification with Hugging Face Transformers
The quality of beans differs from each other based on the geographic locations of its sources. The beans quality is conventionally determined by visual inspection, which is subjective, requiring considerable effort and time and prone to error. This project offers an alternative method that is precise, non-destructive and objective  with the objective of developing an appropriate computer routine that can characterize beans from the images. Imaging techniques were employed to automatically classify the beans samples.

## About Hugging Face Transformers
Hugging Face Transformers package is very popular and versatile Python library that provides pre-trained models for a variety of applications in Computer Vision, as well other areas such as Text classification , audio analysis, multimodal analysis (optical character recognition, video classification, visual question answering and many more). 

#### Focus
- Feature Extraction from Image
- Classifies Multilabel Images into specified class names.
- Evaluating Model

#### Objectives
- Read Image Dataset
- Pre-processing on Image Data
- Feature extraction
- Training Model (ViTForImageClassification)
- Evaluating the model with confusion matrix

#### Setup
The following libraries will be used:
- `pandas` for managing data
- `numpy` for math operations
- `sklearn` for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.
- `seaborn` for visualizing data
- `matplotlib` for additional plotting tools.
